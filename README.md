Folder Structure and Naming Conventions -
Base project folder under `D:/Glacier` has numbered naming.  
For example, `One` is the first mainline production and `1` is the first slack production.  
These folders can be suffixed with ` - Done` once the video has been published to YouTube.  
In the future Mainline and Slack can be put into separate parent folders, but as of right now, this feels natural and it will keep me looking at each unfinished project more often.  

Subdirectory structure under each of these folders -  
`Audio Takes`  
`BGM`  
`Processed Audio`  
`VR Capture`  
The names are pretty self explanatory.

The filenames under these directories are not too strict, but so far `1.wav` under `Audio Takes` and `takeone.wav` under `Processed Audio` has been making sense to me.  
Rest of the two folders can contain native filenames (such as music title for `BGM` and timestamped video capture under `VR Capture`), these feel intuitive.  

As of right now I am not saving `.prproj` files in these directories, or saving the Audacity projects at all (in the future, they can go under an `Audacity Saves` folder. Also the video exports are done to a default folder for now which I have shortcut'd to the desktop `Premiere Exports.lnk`.  

FL Studio Settings for each video will be stored in each project file, such as `1.md` will have the notes from the first video.  
For elegance, I might put up some folder structure into GitHub much sooner than in the Windows folder.
