### Steps I did -
1. Went on to evernote + ChatGPT and wrote out a script involving stepping out into the sun and getting more Vitamin D (and its benefits). `Start 1:22pm`.
2. Recorded on Audacity, no volume changes.
3. Edited out silences on Audacity.
4. Exported audio `1.wav`.
5. Headed on to FL Studio 12.
6. Boosting volume to what is standard on YouTube and enhance voice clarity.  

   Settings -
   Soundgoodizer "A" (default).  
   Fruity Multiband Compressor - click > 12 times.  
   Left mixer volume to default.

7. Exported processed voiceover `takeone.wav`.

   Settings -
   WAV bit depth: 32Bit float.

> healthy non-obsessive break for lunch and some fresh air at 2:30pm. It took at least 2x as long than it should because I am also initiating the GitHub folders, figuring out what all to put in the .md files.

8. Got into VR for captures. `Resuming after lunch at 2:50pm`  
9. Done capturing the goal 31-second clip at `3:12pm`. (Lots of figuring out what gestures to do etc and how far to hold out the hands, since it was the first time). Used all highest possible settings (1920x1080, 20mbps bitrate, 60FPS).

11. Fired up Premiere project and imported files. `3:16 pm`
12. Having gotten a single-take perfect capture on VR, I was done importing and editing by `3:22pm` (besides now having to find out an appropriate background music).

13. Headed over to [media.io](https://www.media.io/lab/ai-music/library) and generated some music I can dig. It only had two free generations so I will have to spend some dedicated time to find a usable music generation site.
14. Headed over to Canva to create a thumbnail.  
15. Took ChatGPT's advice for a semi clickbaity title.
16. Published video by 3:45pm.

Took me a little over **two hours**.
